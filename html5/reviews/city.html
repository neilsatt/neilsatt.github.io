<h3>New York Times</h3> 
<p>
I had a few plans for the day on which I read Michael Connelly's latest mystery. Nothing much, but enough to have made me put the book down once in a while. Well, no way. Not a chance. Everything else took a back seat to following Harry Bosch, Mr. Connelly's tough, moody Hollywood detective, through the author's latest carefully wrought maze. ...'City of Bones' is a clean, tight, propulsive thriller set in the moral murk of detective-story Los Angeles. And it is an incendiary page turner...

<h3>Los Angeles Times</h3> 
<p>
Enough to say this is strong Connelly: well-plotted, lean and spare and more than a little sad...The search for truth leading to unintended consequences is a cautionary theme that has worked since Sophocles, and it works here.

<h3>Washington Post</h3>

City Of Bones is up to the high standards of its predecessors. Connelly's prose has become leaner over the years, and his understanding of how cops work and think remains unsurpassed. ...the best American crime series now in progress.
