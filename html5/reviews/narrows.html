Michael Connelly is one of the best writers around today. When we start to read one of his books we know we will not be disappointed. This book falls well within that category. This book is a real thriller and loaded with suspense. However, these attributes 'thrilling and suspense' would not mean anything without the creativity and talent of Michael Connelly putting it all together. This book is highly recommended. This is Harry Bosch at the top of his game!

<h3>Wall Street Journal</h3>

Mr. Connelly's terrific 14th novel...a suspenseful book marked by flashes of insight and moments of pathos, as well as by dry wit and graceful prose.

<h3>Stephen King, Entertainment Weekly</h3> 
<p>
This is scarifying in a big way - a Thomas Harris kind of scary, which is high praise indeed.
