 Connelly, a crime reporter for the Los Angeles Times, transcends the standard L.A. police procedural with this original and eminently authentic first novel. Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch--former hero cop bumped from the L.A. homicide desk to the lowly Beverly Hills squad--gets the call on a drug death at Mulholland Dam. Harry recognizes the corpse as that of a fellow soldier in Vietnam; both were 'tunnel rats' who searched for Viet Cong in the network of burrows beneath Vietnamese villages. Investigation connects his old pal to an unsolved bank job--the vault was tunneled into from the storm drains below--and Harry takes his information to the FBI.

 One of those books you read with your knuckles - just hanging on until it's over...good and thrilling.

 Don't miss this one...a really wonderful, readable book, and I'm hoping he's working fast on a follow-up.
