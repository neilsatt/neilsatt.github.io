<p><strong>Scott Joplin</strong>
was born in Texas and is considered to be the most influential ragtime composer.</p>

<p>Joplin worked as a traveling musician and by the time he was in his 30's, royalties from some of his compositions helped him start his Opera Company. Unfortunately he never got his major work <em>Treemonisha </em> performed in full during his lifetime, but in 1976 it received a posthumous Pulitzer Prize.</p>

<p>Joplin's most famous works include <em>The Entertainer</em> and the <em>Maple Leaf Rag.</em>

<p><strong>George Gershwin</strong>
was born in New York City, and he spent his life in the United States. </p>

<p>His first break was as a rehearsal pianist on Broadway. His first musical comedy <em>La La Lucille</em> was a success and after that he continued to write many successful musicals including <em>Rhapsody in Blue,</em> and <em>Porgy and Bess</em> which was written about Southern African American culture.</p>

<p>Gershwin died at the young age of 39, but his music made him one of the most important composers of the twentieth century.</p>
